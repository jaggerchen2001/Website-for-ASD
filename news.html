            <figcaption>2024 ASD Calendar on sale now!</figcaption>
            <p>Posted On: 12 Sep 2023</p>
            <p>The 2024 ASD Calendar features some of the dogs that have been rehomed by ASD over the years. The pictures of these wonderful furkids epitomise the love, joy and happiness that each and every one of them experiences when they go to a loving home.</p>
            <p>The proceeds from the sale of the calendars will go towards our 2024 medical budget. As our monthly vet expenses can sometimes exceed $40,000, this is an extremely critical component of the budget.</p>
            <p>The calendar is a full colour high quality table top sized calendar with a small footprint of 15cm (width) by 22 cm (height).</p>
            <p>The cost of each calendar is S$10 and for orders of  20 copies or more, there will be free delivery to any part of Singapore PLUS a FREE GIFT of our 10th Anniversary coffee table book. To place your order, please email  info@asdsingapore.com  with your name, contact number, delivery address and order quantity.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, for orders of less than 20 copies, the ASD calendar is also available at the following locations. You may wish to call ahead to check on stock availability.</p>

            <p>Posted On: 22 Feb 2023</p>
            <p>Please join us for a very special day out on Sunday, 12 March to celebrate 20 years of ASD! </p>
            <p>RedDot Brewhouse will be serving up a scrumptious lunch (a main course and a drink are included in the ticket price), after which you can while away the afternoon browsing around the shopping booths. </p>
            <p>We haven't forgotten about your furkids either. They will get to enjoy a delicious cooked meal lovingly prepared by Furry's Kitchen.</p>
            <p>So what are you waiting for? Scan the QR code or register via google form NOW at: https://forms.gle/44A5W4YcqnwBSxXy7, and one of our volunteers will reach out to you within 48 hours to confirm your slot. </p>
            <p>Although dogs are more than welcome, if your doggo is not comfortable in such a setting, you might want to come unaccompanied and shop for him or her instead. </p>
            <p>Proceeds from this event will be donated to ASD via https://www.giving.sg/action-for-singapore-dogs/asdturns20, where donations are being doubled until 31 March 2023! </p>
            <p>* Please note that we will stop accepting registrations once we hit venue capacity!</p>
